- 67 difference(s) between a and b outside the rollout, judged by release mode
- NOT COLLECTED: vulns of reader, catalogue, live, time on side a: grype is not installed (https://github.com/anchore/grype#installation, or set HARNESS_VULN_CMD to another scanner, e.g. trivy)

### 67 unclaimed differences, 10 causes

Folded by kind across apps, pages and packages. Read beside the verdict; it never changes it.

| cause | differences | apps | pages | example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sbom` package bumped (5 packages: `dompurify`, `entities`, `node`, `tzdata`, `undici`) | 20 | reader, catalogue, live, time | — | reader: package bumped: dompurify 3.4.16 → 3.4.17 |
| `sbom` package added (9 packages: `@supabase/auth-js`, `@supabase/functions-js`, `@supabase/phoenix`, `@supabase/postgrest-js`, `@supabase/realtime-js`, `@supabase/storage-js`, `@supabase/supabase-js`, `iceberg-js` and 1 more) | 9 | reader | — | reader: package added: @supabase/auth-js@2.117.2 |
| `sbom` package removed (9 packages: `@supabase/auth-js`, `@supabase/functions-js`, `@supabase/phoenix`, `@supabase/postgrest-js`, `@supabase/realtime-js`, `@supabase/storage-js`, `@supabase/supabase-js`, `iceberg-js` and 1 more) | 9 | time | — | time: package removed: @supabase/auth-js@2.117.2 |
| `metrics` new series on b (2 names: `http_request_duration_seconds_count`, `http_requests_total`) | 6 | catalogue, live, time | — | catalogue: new series on b: http_request_duration_seconds_count |
| `dom` semantic DOM differs (+# −# lines at line #) | 5 | reader | 5: `reader:course`, `reader:home`, `reader:lab-step`, `reader:lab-step-2`, `reader:topic` | reader:home: semantic DOM differs (+1 −1 lines at line 10) |
| `focus` keyboard order changed (# stops on a, # on b) | 5 | reader | 5: `reader:course`, `reader:home`, `reader:lab-step`, `reader:lab-step-2`, `reader:topic` | reader:home: keyboard order changed (12 stops on a, 12 on b) |
| `image-manifest` built FROM a different base image (lowest layer e#fce → #b#de#) | 4 | reader, catalogue, live, time | — | reader: built FROM a different base image (lowest layer e58989146fce → 9b35de789337) |
| `image-manifest` label org.opencontainers.image.description "" → "The Tutors educational platform - an open-source course reader and learning management system built with Svelte #, SvelteKit, and TypeScript." | 4 | reader, catalogue, live, time | — | reader: label org.opencontainers.image.description "" → "The Tutors educational platform - an open-source course reader and learning management system built wi… |
| `logs` wrote no log line on b (# on a): nothing reached it, or it stopped logging | 3 | catalogue, live, time | — | catalogue: wrote no log line on b (2 on a): nothing reached it, or it stopped logging |
| `network` GET {{asset}} requested #× on a, #× on b (1 route: `GET /_app/immutable/chunks/{{hash}}.js`) | 2 | reader | 2: `reader:course`, `reader:home` | reader:home: GET /_app/immutable/chunks/{{hash}}.js requested 33× on a, 36× on b |

Moved together on the same pages, so likely one change each:

- `dom`, `focus` on 3 pages (6 differences): `reader:lab-step`, `reader:lab-step-2`, `reader:topic`
- `dom`, `focus`, `network` on 2 pages (6 differences): `reader:course`, `reader:home`

Claim each one in the release's `claims.yaml` with the Rule or changelog entry that intends it, or fix it.

### Policy: what b must be (informing)

| app | image-hardening | build-provenance | vuln-ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|
| reader | 1 finding (1 on production too) | holds | not evaluated |
| catalogue | 1 finding (1 on production too) | holds | not evaluated |
| live | 1 finding (1 on production too) | holds | not evaluated |
| time | 1 finding (1 on production too) | holds | not evaluated |

### Informing (5; 5 unclaimed): reported, never gates

18 of 29 engines are blocking; informing (reported, never gates): timing (no date set to block; load/errors still blocks), image-hardening (no date set to block), build-provenance (no date set to block), vuln-ceiling (no date set to block), timing-tolerance (no date set to block), asset-graph (no date set to block), replay (no date set to block), slo (no date set to block), realtime (no date set to block), secrets-in-response (no date set to block), headers-policy (no date set to block). An informing engine's findings never change the verdict, the Gate or the exit code; a claim can still cover one.

| engine | scope | what it found | level | claimed by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `image-hardening` | `reader/unrecorded-base` | reader: records no base image (no org.opencontainers.image.base.name label), so a base that moved upstream reads as a rebuild no PR declared (production too) | no date set | unclaimed |
| `image-hardening` | `catalogue/unrecorded-base` | catalogue: records no base image (no org.opencontainers.image.base.name label), so a base that moved upstream reads as a rebuild no PR declared (production too) | no date set | unclaimed |
| `image-hardening` | `live/unrecorded-base` | live: records no base image (no org.opencontainers.image.base.name label), so a base that moved upstream reads as a rebuild no PR declared (production too) | no date set | unclaimed |
| `image-hardening` | `time/unrecorded-base` | time: records no base image (no org.opencontainers.image.base.name label), so a base that moved upstream reads as a rebuild no PR declared (production too) | no date set | unclaimed |
| `asset-graph` | `reader` | reader: the asset graph changed: 111 → 117 immutable requests (JS 92 → 98, CSS 19 → 19), 1.1 MB → 1.1 MB; 2 network and 0 headers difference(s) are this churn | no date set | unclaimed |
