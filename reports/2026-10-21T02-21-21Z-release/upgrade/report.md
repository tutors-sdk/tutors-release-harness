- the candidate rolled in under load with no failed request
- 36 difference(s) between a and b outside the rollout, judged by release mode
- NOT COLLECTED: vulns of reader, catalogue, live, time on side a: grype is not installed (https://github.com/anchore/grype#installation, or set HARNESS_VULN_CMD to another scanner, e.g. trivy)
- NOT COLLECTED: vulns of reader, catalogue, live, time on side b: grype is not installed (https://github.com/anchore/grype#installation, or set HARNESS_VULN_CMD to another scanner, e.g. trivy)

### 36 unclaimed differences, 6 causes

Folded by kind across apps, pages and packages. Read beside the verdict; it never changes it.

| cause | differences | apps | pages | example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sbom` package added (9 packages: `@supabase/auth-js`, `@supabase/functions-js`, `@supabase/phoenix`, `@supabase/postgrest-js`, `@supabase/realtime-js`, `@supabase/storage-js`, `@supabase/supabase-js`, `iceberg-js` and 1 more) | 9 | reader | — | reader: package added: @supabase/auth-js@2.117.2 |
| `sbom` package removed (9 packages: `@supabase/auth-js`, `@supabase/functions-js`, `@supabase/phoenix`, `@supabase/postgrest-js`, `@supabase/realtime-js`, `@supabase/storage-js`, `@supabase/supabase-js`, `iceberg-js` and 1 more) | 9 | time | — | time: package removed: @supabase/auth-js@2.117.2 |
| `metrics` new series on b (2 names: `http_request_duration_seconds_count`, `http_requests_total`) | 6 | catalogue, live, time | — | catalogue: new series on b: http_request_duration_seconds_count |
| `dom` semantic DOM differs (+# −# lines at line #) | 5 | reader | 5: `reader:course`, `reader:home`, `reader:lab-step`, `reader:lab-step-2`, `reader:topic` | reader:home: semantic DOM differs (+1 −1 lines at line 10) |
| `focus` keyboard order changed (# stops on a, # on b) | 5 | reader | 5: `reader:course`, `reader:home`, `reader:lab-step`, `reader:lab-step-2`, `reader:topic` | reader:home: keyboard order changed (12 stops on a, 12 on b) |
| `network` GET {{asset}} requested #× on a, #× on b (1 route: `GET /_app/immutable/chunks/{{hash}}.js`) | 2 | reader | 2: `reader:course`, `reader:home` | reader:home: GET /_app/immutable/chunks/{{hash}}.js requested 33× on a, 34× on b |

Moved together on the same pages, so likely one change each:

- `dom`, `focus` on 3 pages (6 differences): `reader:lab-step`, `reader:lab-step-2`, `reader:topic`
- `dom`, `focus`, `network` on 2 pages (6 differences): `reader:course`, `reader:home`

### Policy: what b must be (informing)

| app | image-hardening | build-provenance | vuln-ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|
| reader | holds | holds | not evaluated |
| catalogue | holds | holds | not evaluated |
| live | holds | holds | not evaluated |
| time | holds | holds | not evaluated |

### Informing (1; 1 unclaimed): reported, never gates

18 of 27 engines are blocking; informing (reported, never gates): timing (no date set to block; load/errors still blocks), image-hardening (no date set to block), build-provenance (no date set to block), vuln-ceiling (no date set to block), timing-tolerance (no date set to block), asset-graph (no date set to block), replay (no date set to block), slo (no date set to block), realtime (no date set to block). An informing engine's findings never change the verdict, the Gate or the exit code; a claim can still cover one.

| engine | scope | what it found | level | claimed by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `asset-graph` | `reader` | reader: the asset graph changed: 111 → 113 immutable requests (JS 92 → 94, CSS 19 → 19), 1.1 MB → 1.1 MB; 2 network and 0 headers difference(s) are this churn | no date set | unclaimed |
