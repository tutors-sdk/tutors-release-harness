- the candidate rolled in under load with no failed request
- 8 difference(s) between a and b outside the rollout, judged by release mode
- NOT COLLECTED: vulns of reader, catalogue, live, time on side a: grype is not installed (https://github.com/anchore/grype#installation, or set HARNESS_VULN_CMD to another scanner, e.g. trivy)
- NOT COLLECTED: vulns of reader, catalogue, live, time on side b: grype is not installed (https://github.com/anchore/grype#installation, or set HARNESS_VULN_CMD to another scanner, e.g. trivy)

### 8 unclaimed differences, 1 cause

Folded by kind across apps, pages and packages. Read beside the verdict; it never changes it.

| cause | differences | apps | pages | example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sbom` package bumped (2 packages: `apt`, `libapt-pkg6.0`) | 8 | reader, catalogue, live, time | — | reader: package bumped: apt 2.6.1 → 2.6.2 |

### Unclaimed differences (8)

| artefact | scope | what changed |
|---|---|---|
| `sbom` | `reader/apt` | reader: package bumped: apt 2.6.1 → 2.6.2 |
| `sbom` | `reader/libapt-pkg6.0` | reader: package bumped: libapt-pkg6.0 2.6.1 → 2.6.2 |
| `sbom` | `catalogue/apt` | catalogue: package bumped: apt 2.6.1 → 2.6.2 |
| `sbom` | `catalogue/libapt-pkg6.0` | catalogue: package bumped: libapt-pkg6.0 2.6.1 → 2.6.2 |
| `sbom` | `live/apt` | live: package bumped: apt 2.6.1 → 2.6.2 |
| `sbom` | `live/libapt-pkg6.0` | live: package bumped: libapt-pkg6.0 2.6.1 → 2.6.2 |
| `sbom` | `time/apt` | time: package bumped: apt 2.6.1 → 2.6.2 |
| `sbom` | `time/libapt-pkg6.0` | time: package bumped: libapt-pkg6.0 2.6.1 → 2.6.2 |

Claim each one in the release's `claims.yaml` with the Rule or changelog entry that intends it, or fix it.

### Policy: what b must be (informing)

| app | image-hardening | build-provenance | vuln-ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|
| reader | 1 finding (1 on production too) | holds | not evaluated |
| catalogue | 1 finding (1 on production too) | holds | not evaluated |
| live | 1 finding (1 on production too) | holds | not evaluated |
| time | 1 finding (1 on production too) | holds | not evaluated |

### Informing (4; 4 unclaimed): reported, never gates

18 of 29 engines are blocking; informing (reported, never gates): timing (no date set to block; load/errors still blocks), image-hardening (no date set to block), build-provenance (no date set to block), vuln-ceiling (no date set to block), timing-tolerance (no date set to block), asset-graph (no date set to block), replay (no date set to block), slo (no date set to block), realtime (no date set to block), secrets-in-response (no date set to block), headers-policy (no date set to block). An informing engine's findings never change the verdict, the Gate or the exit code; a claim can still cover one.

| engine | scope | what it found | level | claimed by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `image-hardening` | `reader/unrecorded-base` | reader: records no base image (no org.opencontainers.image.base.name label), so a base that moved upstream reads as a rebuild no PR declared (production too) | no date set | unclaimed |
| `image-hardening` | `catalogue/unrecorded-base` | catalogue: records no base image (no org.opencontainers.image.base.name label), so a base that moved upstream reads as a rebuild no PR declared (production too) | no date set | unclaimed |
| `image-hardening` | `live/unrecorded-base` | live: records no base image (no org.opencontainers.image.base.name label), so a base that moved upstream reads as a rebuild no PR declared (production too) | no date set | unclaimed |
| `image-hardening` | `time/unrecorded-base` | time: records no base image (no org.opencontainers.image.base.name label), so a base that moved upstream reads as a rebuild no PR declared (production too) | no date set | unclaimed |
